## Description:

Developed a C# calculator project integrated with Microsoft SQL Server. The project allows users to perform calculations while being connected to a database, enabling functionalities such as user login, registration, and history tracking.

## Details:

- Users can login or register to use the calculator.
- Calculations performed by users are saved to a database, associated with their username.
- Utilized Microsoft SQL Server for user authentication and storing calculation histories.

## Technologies Used:

- C# Programming Language
- Microsoft SQL Server
- .NET 5.0

## Contributions:

- Designed and implemented the core logic and user interface of the calculator.
- Wrote the C# code to establish connection with Microsoft SQL Server for database operations.
- Implemented functionalities for user authentication and viewing calculation history.

## Results and Learning:
This project enhanced my C# programming skills and knowledge of database management, particularly in integrating Microsoft SQL Server. Understanding how to establish database connections and manipulate data using SQL Server was invaluable. Additionally, incorporating functionalities like user authentication and history tracking provided insights into effective software development practices.
